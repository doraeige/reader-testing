## Project Overview
RSS Feed Reader coded with Javascript ES6.

### What tests are written to check
* Write a test that iterates through all sources in the allFeeds object to ensure that there are linking fields and the link is not empty.
* Write a test that iterates through all the sources in the allFeeds object to ensure that there is a name field and is not empty.
* Write a test case to ensure that the menu elements are hidden by default. You need to analyze html and css to figure out how we implemented the hide/show menu elements.
* Write a test case to ensure that the menu will switch to the visible state when the menu icon is clicked. This test should contain two expectations: whether the menu is displayed when the icon is clicked, and hidden when clicked again.
* Write a test to ensure that the loadFeed function is called and works fine, that is, there is at least one element of .entry in the .feed container element.
* Write a test case called "New Feed Selection"
* Writing a test ensures that the content will really change when a new source is loaded with the loadFeed function.
